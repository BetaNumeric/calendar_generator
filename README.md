# **Calendar Generator**

I built this simple tool because I needed a better way to generate calendars for my design work. I wanted clean, editable vector files for Adobe Illustrator without having to manually type out dates every year.

It runs entirely in the browser. If you need clean SVGs for print design or just a quick high-res calendar image, feel free to use it.

## **What it does**

* **Vector SVGs:** Exports clean files where text remains text and grids are simple strokes. Perfect for ungrouping and editing in Illustrator, Inkscape, or Affinity.  
* **Raster Images:** Can also save high-resolution PNG or JPG files (up to 9600px).  
* **Batch Export:** Download the entire year as a .zip file.  
* **Localization:** Supports English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian.  
* **Customization:** Includes "Dark Mode", transparent backgrounds, and standard web-safe fonts.

## **How to use**

1. Open the [Live Demo](https://betanumeric.github.io/calendar_generator/) (or just open index.html in your browser).  
2. Adjust the **Year**, **Language**, and **Font** settings.  
3. Click **Save SVG** to download the current month, or **Zip** to grab the whole year at once.

## **Under the hood**

It's a **single-file application**. I used React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide Icons, all loaded via CDN. This means the entire app lives inside one portable index.html file.
