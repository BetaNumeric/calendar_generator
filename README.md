# **Calendar Generator**

[**Live Demo**](https://betanumeric.github.io/calendar_generator/)

I built this simple tool because I needed a better way to generate calendars for my design work. I wanted clean, editable vector files for Adobe Illustrator without having to manually type out dates every year.

It runs entirely in your browser—no installation or server required. If you need clean SVGs for print design or just a quick high-res calendar image, feel free to use it.

## **What it does**

* **Vector SVGs:** Exports clean files where text remains text and grids are simple strokes. Perfect for ungrouping and editing in Illustrator, Inkscape, or Affinity.  
* **Raster Images:** Can also save high-resolution PNG or JPG files (up to 9600px).  
* **Batch Export:** Download the entire year as a .zip file.  
* **Localization:** Supports 16 languages, including English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Dutch.  
* **Deep Customization:**  
  * **Typography:** Choose fonts and adjust date sizes.  
  * **Colors:** Full control over text, background, and grid colors.  
  * **Layout:** Adjust margins and align numbers (e.g., Top-Left vs Center).  
  * **Week Start:** Toggle between Monday or Sunday start.

## **How to use**

1. Open the [Live Demo](https://betanumeric.github.io/calendar_generator/) (or just open index.html in your browser).  
2. Select your **Year** and **Language**.  
3. Click **Adjust** to tweak colors, fonts, and layout.  
4. Click **Save SVG** to download the current month, or **Zip** to grab the whole year at once.

## **Under the hood**

It's a **single-file application**. I used React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide Icons, all loaded via CDN. This means the entire app lives inside one portable index.html file with no build steps or npm install needed.
